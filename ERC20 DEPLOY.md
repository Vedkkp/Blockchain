## What is ERC 20 Token?
ERC-20 tokens are a type of cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum Blockchain. They are digital tokens that can represent anything from shares in a company to virtual assets in a game.


# How to deploy ERC 20.

## MetaMask
1. Create your **MetaMask wallet** *(get the wallet address)*.

## Goerli Faucet

# Here are some steps to deploy ERC-20 or creating a Token.

## MetaMask
1. Create your MetaMask wallet (get the wallet address).
2. In MetaMask go to setting then connect to Goreli Test-network.
3. At the moment you will not have any GoreliETH, so we need to mine it.
4. From https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/ this website you can mine GoreliETH by using your wallet address. Then mine more then 0.01 .

## 20lab
1. Go to https://20lab.app/ this website.(20lab is an ERC-20 token generator tool)
2. Click Open App, then click on start.
3. Choose blockchain Goreli(Testnet), then enter your Token name, Token symbol, Initial supply (take very large number), 18 Decimals.
4. Now, you can choose the desired features you want then save it.
5. Then velidate and compile, it will connect to your MetaMask for GoreliETH (gas fee).
6. Then you can see your Tokan name and address in Dashboard.

### Go to https://goerli.etherscan.io/ this website then give your Token address in search-bar or click Etherscan icon below your token address in 20lab. 
Now, you can see your transactions history of that Token.
